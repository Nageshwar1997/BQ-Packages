 * A text box that is mirrored in a URL query param (a search box and `?search=...`).
 *
 * - Typing shows in the box straight away; the URL is updated `delay` ms after the last keystroke
 *   (trimmed, and the param is removed when the text is empty).
 * - When the URL param changes on its own - another filter resets it, the user presses Back/Forward,
 *   a "Clear" button - the box follows it. The URL update this box made itself coming back does not
 *   touch the box, so whatever the user is still typing (a trailing space, the next letters) stays.
 * - A typed text that is waiting for its debounce is dropped if the box was changed in the meantime
 *   (reset by another filter, or `clear()`), so it cannot put an old search back into the URL.
 * - `flush()` sends the waiting text now (e.g. on Enter); `isPending()` says whether one is waiting.
 * - A text that `useBlocker` holds is still expected (`proceed()` delivers it) and stops being
 *   expected when the blocker is reset; one that was redirected or replaced is never expected.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const search = useQueryParamInput('search');
 *
 * <input value={search.value} onChange={(event) => search.setValue(event.target.value)} />
 * <button onClick={search.clear}>Clear</button>
 * ```
 *
 * Needs to be rendered inside a React Router (`react-router-dom`) router.
 *
 * @param key - The query param the box is mirrored in.
