 *
 * - Listens for `pointerdown` on `document` in the capture phase, so an inner `stopPropagation()`
 *   cannot hide the press.
 * - "Inside" is decided from the path the event took (`event.composedPath()`), not from
 *   `element.contains(event.target)`. The path is fixed when the event is dispatched, so it stays
 *   right when the pressed node is removed by another listener first, and it sees through open shadow
 *   roots (where `target` is retargeted to the shadow host).
 * - A popup portalled out of the element is not inside it in the DOM: list its ref in `ignore`.
 * - The listener is added once and only re-added when `enabled` (or whether `onFocusOutside` is given)
 *   changes: the latest `callback`, `ignore` and `onFocusOutside` are used, so passing new ones on every
 *   render costs nothing.
 *
 * @param callback - Called with the `pointerdown` event.
 * @param options - `enabled` (default `true`) switches the listener off, `ignore` lists portalled
 * popups, `onFocusOutside` adds focus moving outside.
