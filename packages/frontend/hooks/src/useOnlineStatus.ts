 *
 * For code outside React, e.g. an API client:
 * - `onlineStatusStore.confirmOnline()` when the server answered a request (any answer),
 * - `onlineStatusStore.recheck()` when a request got no answer at all,
 * - `onlineStatusStore.subscribe(listener)` / `onlineStatusStore.getStatus()` to follow the status.

/**
 * Whether the user can reach the internet, kept up to date while the component is mounted.
 *
 * - The browser's `online` / `offline` events are one trigger. When the network comes back the status
 *   is `connecting` until a real request gets an answer, because "the network interface is up" does
 *   not mean "the internet works" (Wi-Fi joined, no data yet).
 * - The browser says nothing when the Wi-Fi has no internet behind it (a phone hotspot with its data
 *   off), so while online and visible the internet is also asked every 15 seconds (see
 *   `heartbeatMs` of `createOnlineStatusStore`). Two checks in a row without an answer make it
 *   `offline`; the first answer makes it `online` again.
 * - Every component that uses it shares one listener and one check.
 * - The first render is already right (no flash of the wrong status), and a server always says
 *   `online`.
 * - Nothing runs while no component uses it.
 *
 * The status is also better informed by the app's own requests: call
 * `onlineStatusStore.confirmOnline()` when the server answered one, and `onlineStatusStore.recheck()`
 * when one got no answer (see {@link onlineStatusStore}). With TanStack Query, feed the status to its
 * `onlineManager` so queries wait instead of failing while there is no internet.
 *
 * @param store - Where the status comes from. Pass a store made with `createOnlineStatusStore()` (and
 * created once, outside of the component) to use another probe URL, check interval or waits between
 * tries. @default onlineStatusStore
