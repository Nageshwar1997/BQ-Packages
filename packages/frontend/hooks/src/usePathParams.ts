/**
 * Current route info in one place: the route's dynamic `pathParams`, the `location` (also spread
 * flat: `pathname`, `search`, `hash`, `state`, `key`), `paths` (the pathname split into its
 * non-empty segments) and `navigate`.
 *
 * - `location` is the router's own object, for code that passes a whole location on (`<Navigate
 *   state={location} />`, `useBlocker`, comparing two locations). The flat copies are for the common
 *   case of needing one field, so `const { pathname } = usePathParams()` works. Both are the same
 *   values and change together.
 * - The returned object keeps its identity until the location changes, and `pathParams` and `paths`
 *   only change when their content does, so they are safe in dependency arrays.
 * - While a `useBlocker` blocks a navigation nothing here changes, because the router's location
 *   does not: `reset()` leaves it as it was and `proceed()` moves it.
 *
 * The keys of `pathParams` can be given once, by the page that knows its route:
 * `usePathParams<'categoryL1' | 'slug'>()` types `pathParams.slug` as `string | undefined` and
 * rejects a misspelt key. A record type works too (`usePathParams<{ slug?: string }>()`). Without a
 * type argument any key is allowed, as before.
 *
 * Needs to be rendered inside a React Router (`react-router-dom`) router.
