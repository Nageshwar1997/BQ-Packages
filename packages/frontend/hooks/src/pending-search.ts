/**
 * The query string that `useQueryParams` has navigated to but nothing shows yet.
 *
 * `navigate()` does not change the URL in the same tick: with a data router (`createBrowserRouter`) it
 * commits a few ms later, and with a declarative router React renders it a moment later. Until then,
 * every `useQueryParams()` on the page - however many components use it - must build its next update
 * on this one, not on the old URL, or the updates overwrite each other (status picked in one
 * component, search typed in another, `removeParams` and `setParams` in the same handler...). So it
 * is kept here, shared by all instances, instead of inside each hook.
 *
 * It lives only for that moment. With a data router `useQueryParams` clears it as soon as the
 * navigation has finished one way or another (committed, replaced by a newer navigation, blocked by
 * `useBlocker`, redirected) and then asks the router itself, so it never outlives the navigation.
 * With a declarative router there is nothing to ask, so it is cleared when the URL shows it, or
 * forgotten after `PENDING_SEARCH_MAX_AGE_MS`. Updates are made from event handlers and timers, never
 * while rendering, so nothing here runs on the server.
