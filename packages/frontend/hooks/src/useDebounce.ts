/**
 * Debounces `callback`: after the last `trigger(...args)`, waits `delay` ms and then calls it once
 * with those args.
 *
 * - The `callback` that runs is the one from the **latest render**, not the one from the render
 *   `trigger()` was called in, so it never sees stale state.
 * - `trigger` and `cancel` keep the same identity between renders (only a new `delay` gives a new
 *   `trigger`), so an inline `callback` is fine and they are safe in dependency arrays.
 * - A pending call is cancelled when the component unmounts, and a `trigger()` made after that is
 *   ignored.
 * - `flush()` runs the pending call right now (e.g. when the user presses Enter) and nothing runs
 *   again when its time would have come; it does nothing when no call is pending. `isPending()` says
 *   whether a call is waiting. Both are functions that read the current state, not values, so asking
 *   never causes a re-render.
 *
 * Returns `{ trigger, cancel, flush, isPending }` rather than a bare callable - `cancel` (mirrors lodash's
 * `_.debounce().cancel()`) is needed by any caller that sometimes has to bypass the debounce and
 * commit a value immediately: without explicitly cancelling, a still-pending timeout from an
 * *earlier* trigger() call survives an immediate/direct update and fires later anyway, clobbering
 * it with stale data. (An earlier version tried attaching `.cancel` onto the trigger function
 * itself instead, to keep call sites unchanged - the react-hooks/refs and react-hooks/immutability
 * lint rules both reject that shape, since it either mutates a hook-returned value after creation
 * or passes a ref-touching closure through useMemo/Object.assign in a way they can't verify is
 * safe. A plain two-function object sidesteps both.)
